### Features

Balrog is a work in progress, we currently have color and an OLC. 

### TO COMPILE AND RUN:

Go into the src directory and type "make" wait for the program to finish compiling then change into the area directory
and then type "./startup &" IF everything goes smoothly Balrog should be running on the default port of 9000

A default immortal has been created and put inside of the player directory. Log in using "admin" for the character's
name and password. From here you can advance mortals to immortals.

### To contribute 

We currently use github.com as our source of collaboration. We assume you have knowledge of how git works, if you are new
to git, You should look up tutorials on how to push, pull, fetch, and use branches. Before you contribute we ask that you
remove all object files (file.o), and remove the rom executable from the src directory, clear your logs in the log directory,
and remove any new players or areas that you may have created. You cannot push to the master branch on github, you must first
make a pull request.
 

If you have any questions on Balrog or git, feel free to look us up on irc. We're currently at irc.esper.net channel #Shroud
